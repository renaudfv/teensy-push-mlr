# teensy-push-mlr
Teensy based implementation of Monome's MLR, meant to be used with Ableton Push 1.

## Design
Based on the GoF Observer design pattern, it follows the same principles as the MVC architecture.
I'd rather call it MSC (Model Sense Controller), since it does not only involve viewing things but hearing, recording, touching physical interfaces and perceiving time.
